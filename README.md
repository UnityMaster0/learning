# Learning Projects

** This repository offers examples of different potential beginner projects you could undertake in Java. These projects can hopefully inspire your own projects **

Steps to Make a Good Project:
1. Define an objective
* The objective must be to produce some sort of usable product
* Many projects fall into the trap of "trying to learn blank" or "experimenting with blank." It is important to produce a functional product, as simply experimenting doesn't push you and will not help you learn.
* In the pursuit of a useable product, you will have to find solutions and learn about new problems
2. Be able to identify deliverables
* Having a clear goal of what you want to be produced and achieved by your project will help you have the vision and direction to complete it
3. Finish the project before moving onto another
* This is obviously subject to exception as it is possible to unwittingly undertake a project beyond your abilities
* Being consistent in your learning is the most important part of long-term success
